        <b>Crown shyness</b>
        (also 
        <i>canopy disengagement,<sub>[1]</sub> canopy shyness,<sub>[2]</sub> or 
        inter-crown spacing<sub>[3])</sub>
        </i>
        
        is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, 
        in which the crown of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, 
        forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sub>[4]</sub>
        <sub>[5]</sub>The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same 
        species, but also occurs between trees
        of different species.<sub>[6]</sub>
        <sub>[17]</sub> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown 
        shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it
        might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sub>[8]</sub>

        The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
        <sub>[6]</sub>
        The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 
        1920s.<sub>[9]</sub> The variety of hypotheses and experimental results 
        might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different 
        species, an example of convergent evolution.<sub>[citation needed]</sub>
        Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
        leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy areas 
        suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds; 
        the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. Studies 
        suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours
        until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sub>[10]</sub> If the crowns are
        artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill 
        the canopy gaps.<sub>[11]</sub>This explains instances of crown shyness 
        between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that 
        shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, 
        including windy forests,stands of flexible trees, and early succession 
        forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.
        <sub>[6]</sub>
        <sub>[12]</sub> According to this theory, variable flexibility in 
        lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
