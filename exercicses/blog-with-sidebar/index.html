                <p>
                   When EA Games released The Sims 2 in 2004 for PC, it became 
                   an instant success. Immediately after its launch, it received 
                   rave reviews from critics and gamers alike. Since then, EA 
                   has released many expansion packs for Sims 2 and its 
                   successors, Sims 3 and Sims 4.

                   However, the follow-up games have slowly lost the same 
                   excitement and critical acclaim garnered by their 
                   predecessor. No entry in the series has earned the praise and 
                   love that The Sims 2 did. EA has faced critique from 
                   reviewers and gamers alike and was named the "Worst Company 
                   in America" by Consumerist two years in a row. Despite all 
                   this, The Sims franchise has soldiered on, and Sims 2 has 
                   become a true cult classic.
